So yes, my day was okay… everything looked normal from the outside. But somewhere I did feel a little heavy. Not because I expect anything from you  just because I care more than I show.

I don’t need apologies, and I’m not questioning your stress. I know you’re going through a lot. I just sometimes wonder how we went from being everything to barely talking in just a week. Maybe it’s just this phase. Maybe it’s timing.

I’ve never really surrendered my ego or self-respect for anyone before, but with you it never felt like losing something — it felt like choosing something. And I’m still choosing to try.

Tomorrow is Valentine’s Day, and it’s funny how dates work… but for me, ours will always be 12 June — that soft weather you love. I don’t care about the world’s version.

I’m focused on my studies too. I’m handling things. I just wanted you to know that I’m here — not perfectly, not Forcebly  just honestly.

I won’t lie. This week broke something inside me. I cried. I begged God. I stayed awake almost two-three nights straight thinking about my mistakes. There were moments I was so frustrated at myself that I even hurt myself for not handling things better.

In between all of that, I still studied. I was disciplined. I wrote poetry for you. I made tunes. I tried to turn my chaos into something meaningful that can get you back.

I don’t fully understand what I’ve become in this process, but I know one thing with absolute clarity — I have loved you sincerely. Without trust issues. Without suspicion.

If there is distance now, I don’t think it comes from loosing feelings. I think it comes from misunderstandings, and maybe from experiences with people who were never me.

I’ve made some decisions and changes that you might only understand months from now. I didn’t do them for praise. I didn’t do them for sympathy. I did them because I care deeply.

I don’t expect anything in return. I just always wanted to be trusted for who I truly am.

i have thought a lot of things maybe something i shld not have like one day i will come up and hug u a bit forcebly and cry like a baby , like i really want to in your arms and ask for everything once more that was snatched from us due to misunderstanding, but at the same time things have stopped me from doi  ng it as it feels a bit too much but aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i just want to cry in your arms while hugging you once . (having tears in my eyes while typing this)

Lately nothing feels the same. Songs don’t feel like songs anymore. Even the soft wind doesn’t calm me the way it used to. It’s like I’ve become detached from the highs and lows of life — as if someone quietly separated my heart from me and I’m just functioning without it.

I won’t lie — somewhere I’m surviving on the hope that one day there will be forgiveness, understanding, maybe even acceptance again.

My friends tell me to let it go. Some even say I should block you and move on. But they don’t understand what you mean to me. I’ve never been someone who chases acceptance or bends for people. That’s not who I am. But you… you mattered. You still do.

Your single message can take away my sleep. It makes me restless. And yes, I expect things from you sometimes — maybe I shouldn’t, especially right now — but in moments of emotional disaster, even a strong man looks for someone special to hold him steady.

This time, though, I’m standing alone. And I’m trying to handle that too.

The irony of the situation is that i always believed you deserve better, but i cant stop myself from loving you. I just cant.

 whne it all started we were like that , u wasnt active day and night for me instead you were replying hours after i used to buti ask to divine power is this the case right now? does she wants it all back? if yes, i would throw away everything other than my padhai and sleep and i will just commit my life to my carrear and her. there is nothing more important to me in my life than my career , You, money , freedom, i am crazy i know that and i also know that women and girls dont like simp boys but remember i am not just a boy, i am/was you boyfriend/patidev.

i am not a roman god of desire, affection, and erotic love maybe but its okay. I am just a boy, a man , the Iktara. this world held extremely significant value for my personality and my dedication for this love. 

I now know that, i met the perfect girl but maybe at the wrong time. It all depends on her decision. If you say no, i will simply move away from your life, and be the way i was in 9th and 10th. I will love you even if you wont notice i will love you even if you will hurt me and i will love you even if you will ve with someone else. But you will never ever know. But maybe there will be a guy friend like Harsh will be also in your life which one day will tell you that what you are to me



here are few important clearity razia which hurt you and i want you to rethink about them
I read your letters i tried to write replies but razia trust me it was a hell time for me . Ask ayush ask alok ask ayushman ask yourself or whoever is preparing for jee how would they have felt at that moment knowing that yes they did very padhai but a mistake kn excutions bcz they lost guidance in 12th. The diffrence between your case and mine is that your grades was not sooooooo drastically declined and you didnt had that heart attack kinda situation . i mean you did but please imagine about someone who was a all batches topper in delhi and noida .And for me it was like "if i fail in jee razia will be ashamed in JP to call me her boyfirend i must not be failed" .  I am not justifying that thing but i am not a bad guy razia. And i dont want to hear "i know you are not a bad guy" i want to hear " its alright i accept you" but my  eyes only feel the thirst to read that text from your side. So the lettter you sent me, razia, i loved to read them but you maybe wont understand my conditions at that moment right now but i was as panicked as you are right now back then all the time. Yes i could have used chatgpt to reply everything like all my friends and maybe yours do but i just want honesty and genuinity. i never ever used any AI to impress you and i will not but i just dont want to see lossing this take of mine in front of everyone who does that. is this the case? should i have used AI? no, i love you i cant let someone or something type what my hearts hold for you Agar tu mere liye kuch na hoti mai tujhe for granted lia hota mai na kr rha hota its simple maths........



where ever i went i never cared but people respected me, they had this sort of a special attention for me and i saw it but yes maybe its my illusion but i know something cant be an illusion for more that 3 years. but i was always very afraid of attachments in my life. always. i didnt even especifically wanted a girlfriend at any point in my life , but i got you and yes with god's plan you became my closest something. Something in front of whom i am who i am and Something in front of whom  i feel life's ecstasy. You are and were the best of the girls i ever spent time with but i know i misbehaved. i am also here because in my hard times you stayed with me, its my duty and i love to do it to stay with you as long as you need.
Love cant be begged , love is an art, but i know you loved me and you still have this place for me (not simping again) in your heart, hiding somewhere , suffocating it because , idk "because". but you never did anything wrong . If there will be a future debate in some people who will see what we were and know our full story , maybe the closest mistake of yours they will find is choosing me
i am sorry it will sound harsh from now on but let me tell you, i am still behaving the way i am because i behaved the way i was not. I never beg but i surrender in front of people who loves me knowing they wont harm me intentionally, i never simp, because getting a girl because you are a good simp is just is less better than just paying 1000 rupee someone to be in a relationship. all i am doing is because i believe i commited mistakes, i have explained myself , and i accepted it and I HAVE FUKING CHANGED my entire physce after it., but yes razia, after a certain points people should and people would see the things how they want to see and wants to be suited by there comfort. 

I can be yours and i want you to be mine and i am ready to be with you for you but i can not be a trier, i cannot propose you 30 times in 2 year and wait for your breakup and then set my chances for you, i never was like that. even in 11th when we started talking i thought you and ayush are still dating but in 2024 march  i got to know you both broke up LOOOOOOOOONG ago and i was in false illusion.

Dont complicate Love so much, 
Love is a feeling of happy to compromise for someone to see them smile a bit, to put themselves above you, but in all of that, TO BUILD TOGETHER, TO GROW TOGETHER AND MOST IMPORTANTLY TO CRY AND LAUGH TOGETHER.
Razia, i am just 16 and you are just 18, we are still immature MFKS but i know one thing that is we love each other and in this age things become feelingless, meaningless but that should not affect the hopes of love ever. We will live 70 years more together and i will acheive some maturity that will make you feel magical.


and since today is the day they all celebrate valentines day, but we only do it on 12th bcz of 2 reasons, First, ITS FUCKING 12TH JUNE WHY U NEED ANY EXPLANATION MAN!!!!! Second, YOU LOVE THAT WEATHER I KNOW THAT.



i will know your answers in your behaviour i never needed a word to see whats going on my lovers heart.



If you ask me will i be your valentines my respose would be 
I love you even when I know you’re not mine,
I love you even when I know you'd never be mine,
I love you even when you don't want me and
I love you even when you would never give me a reason to ever stop myself from loving you,
You're my morning and night,
I love you even if I'm a bad memory,
I love you even when you've forgotten me,
I love you even when you're someone else's,
I love how you've consumed me,
Body, mind and soul,
I love how you make me a fool,
A fool in love.
And i cannot be less than yours, totally yours.
but for this world(for which i dont give two fucks) will you be my valentines?????
will you be?
can we grow together? Build togehter, Laugh and cry togehter without any hesitation can we do that? can we take a promise of not repeating the mistakes we do? can we ????
dont answer me if you dont want but write it in yes or no in any notebook front of you?
Can we??

just because something is fleeting something is getting bad doesnt mean its meaningless. i know what you are going through but you dont have to go through this alone. You have me.
